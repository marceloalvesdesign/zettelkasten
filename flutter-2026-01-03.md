Check if there are any devices available:

```sh
flutter devices
```

If not, create a new device using an existing emulator:

```sh
flutter emulators
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
```

```sh
flutter devices
```

Pick one device and run it with a flavor:

```sh
flutter run --flavor dev -d <device_id>
```
